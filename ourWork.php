    <p>The secret of rug restoration is matching extremely closely how a carpet was woven originally.</p>
<p>
    <u>Some of our more basic techniques include:</u><br/>
    <ul>
    	<li>Edge-binding along the sides of rugs</li>
        <li>End-stopping on the end of rugs to halt unravelling</li>
        <li>Reweaving holes caused by moths, pets, impact, furniture and age</li>
        <li>Replacing bad old repairs</li>
        <li>Re-piling (re-knotting) areas that have been worn to the foundation to recreate original design</li>
        <li>Embroidering design when reknotting is not an option(such as in extensive heavily worn areas)</li>
        <li>backing very worn carpets (conservation of antique pieces)</li>
        <li>Stabilization of weak carpets (sewing up slits and brittle areas)</li>
        <li>Reweaving kelims (flatwoven rugs)</li>
    </ul>
    
</p>
<p>
<u>Additional services include:</u><br/>
	<ul>
    	<li>Preparing rugs to be hung on walls</li>
        <li>Cutting rugs to fit a particular space or to get rid of irrepairable damage</li>
        <li>Cutting holes for electrical cords</li>
        <li>Redying when repiling is not an option</li>
        <li>Some stain removal</li>
        <li>Moth-proofing consultations</li>
        <li>Dying old repairs to match the rest of the rug</li>
        <li>Making pillows of rugs that are damaged beyond repair</li>
    </ul>
