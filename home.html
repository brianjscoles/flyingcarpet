          <p style="font-style:italic">I restore, stabilize and re-dye mostly Middle Eastern hand woven rugs, but also work on Navajo, European, Chinese and Tibetan carpets. My large collection of materials and naturally dyed wool ensures perfect matching of color and structure. I use natural substances like indigo, madder root and walnut hulls and can also custom dye for your project. I work with distinguished private clients, and the finest Bay Area rug stores, but can also offer solutions to clients with limited budgets. I give estimates,  explain options and do exactly what I agree upon with my clients. I am able to work at any level of perfection. I can suggest both conventional and unconventional ways of dealing with damage on your carpet tailored to your need. Due to low overhead, my prices are very reasonable. I work mostly in my studio at my home in Oakland, but on occasion, when a carpet is too difficult to move, I am prepared to work at your site.</p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">I am reliable, punctual, thorough and efficient. You will be pleased with my service.</p>
