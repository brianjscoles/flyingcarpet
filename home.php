          <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
          <p>We have over 35 years of experience working on fine antique and contemporary weavings in Germany and in the United States.</p>
          
          <h3>WHAT WE WORK ON</h3>
          <p>Mostly we restore, or stabilize, Middle Eastern antique hand woven rugs, but also repair Navajos, European, Chinese and Tibetan carpets. Occasionally we work on modern reproductions and other hand made textiles of any origin. Upon request we  can re-dye old, badly matching repairs, faded areas, or touch up white dots as needed, using textile dye.</p>
          
          <h3>OUR  MATERIALS</h3>
          <p>Our large collection of materials and high quality naturally dyed wool ensures perfect matching of color and structure. We use traditional, natural substances such as indigo, madder root or walnut hulls, and can also custom-dye for your project.</p>
          
          <h3>OUR CLIENTS</h3>
          <p>We work with the finest Bay Area rug stores and many distinguished private clients, but can also offer solutions to clients with limited budgets.</p>
          
          <h3>PRICING</h3>
          <p>We give estimates, explain options, and do exactly what we agree upon with our customers. We are able to work at any level of perfection. We can suggest both conventional and unconventional ways of dealing with carpet damage, tailored to your expectation. Due to low overhead, our prices are very reasonable.</p>
          
          <h3>LOCATION</h3>
          <p>We work mostly in our home-studio in Oakland, but on occasion, when a carpet is too difficult to move, we are prepared (and equipped) to work at your site.</p>
          
          <h3>OUR GUARANTEE</h3>
          <p>We are reliable, punctual, thorough and efficient. You will be pleased with our service.</p>
