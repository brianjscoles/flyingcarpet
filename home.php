We restore, stabilize and redye mostly Middle Eastern handwoven rugs, but also work on Navajos, European, Chinese and Tibetan carpets. Our large collection of materials and naturally dyed wool ensures perfect matching of colour and structure. We use natural substances such as indigo, madder root or walnut hulls, and can also custom-dye for your project. We work with the finest Bay Area rug stores and many distinguished private clients,  but can also offer solutions to clients with limited budgets. We give estimates, explain options and do exactly what we agree upon with our customers.<a name="scrollDown"> </a>We are able to work at any level of perfection. We can suggest both conventional and unconventional ways of dealing with carpet damage tailored to your need. Due to low overhead, our prices are very reasonable. We work mostly in our home-studio in Oakland, but on occasion, when a carpet is too difficult to move, we are prepared to work at your site.</p>
<p>We are reliable, punctual, thorough and efficient. You will be pleased with our service.</p>
